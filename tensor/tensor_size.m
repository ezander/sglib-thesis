function d=tensor_size(T)
% TENSOR_SIZE Return the size of the tensor.
%   D=TENSOR_SIZE(T) Returns the size of the tensor T as an array, i.e. if
%   T is a I1xI2xI3x... tensor then D=[I1,I2,I3,...].
%
% Example (<a href="matlab:run_example tensor_size">run</a>)
%   T=tensor_null( [3,4,5] );
%   tensor_size( T )
