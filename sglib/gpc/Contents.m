% GPC Description of the gpc functions.
%   Basically the GPC functions work just like PCE functions with one small
%   difference: where for the PCE it was enough to specify a multiindex
%   set, for GPC you have to specify the type polynomials as well. In sglib
%   there are two ways of doing that: either you have one set of
%   polynomials for all random variables or they can be different. In the
%   first case, to have normalised Hermite polynomials for everything, you
%   would specify
%      V_a = {'h', multiindex(4, 2)}
%   and pass that to one of the GPC functions. If you want normalised and
%   non-normalised polynomials of different type you could use e.g.
%      V_a = {'hHpP', multiindex(4, 2)}
%   Note that generally the functions that use only one type of polynomials
%   are faster. So, its also better to say {'h', multiindex(4, 2)} instead
%   of {'hhhh', multiindex(4, 2)}, even though they compute the same thing.
%
%   The polynomials systems are defined in the following way: Each system
%   is represented by a single letter, which is the usual mathematical
%   notation for that system, e.g. 'H' for Hermite polynomials, 'P' for
%   Legendre polynomials. If the polynomials shall be normalised a small
%   letter must be used, e.g. 'h' for normalised Hermite polynomials. The
%   following systems are defined within sglib:
%
%     H, h: stochastic Hermite polynomials
%     P, p: Legendre polynomials (on (-1, 1))
%     L, l: Laguerre polynomials
%     T, t: Chebyshev polynomials, 1st kind
%     U, u: Chebyshev polynomials, 2nd kind
%
%   The corresponding random variables are:
%     N(0,1):   standard normal, i.e. mean 0, variance 1
%     U(-1, 1): uniform on (-1,1)
%     Exp(1):   exponential distribution with parameter 1
%     AS:       shifted Arcsine distribution on [-1, 1]
%     W(1):     Wigner semicircle distribution, 2*Beta(3/2,3/2)-1
%
%   Further, as a convenience, with some functions you can use 'M' for the
%   monomials. Note, however, that this does not work for all functions
%   since there is no probability measure associated with the monomials.
%
% Todo:
%     * gpc_add and gpc_multiply needs to be implemented
%     * need functions to manipulate the {polysys, multiindex} pairs (call
%       them gpcspace?)
%     * better performance for mixed case by caching over polynomials
%       systems
