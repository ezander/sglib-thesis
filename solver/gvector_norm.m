function [d,dsqr]=gvector_norm( T, G )
% GVECTOR_NORM Compute the norm of a sparse vector.
%   D=GVECTOR_NORM( T, G ) computes the norm of the sparse vector product
%   T with respect to scalar product defined by the matrices given in G. G
%   may be ommitted or single entries in G may be empty, in which case the
%   Euclidean scalar product is used.
%   As second output argument the square of the norm is also returned
%   (i.e. if the function is called like [D,DSQR]=GVECTOR_NORM( T, G )).
%
%
% Example (<a href="matlab:run_example gvector_norm">run</a>)
%   T={rand(8,2), rand(10,2)};
%   fprintf('%f\n', gvector_norm( T ) )
%   Z=gvector_add(T,T,-1);
%   fprintf('%f\n', gvector_norm( Z ) )
