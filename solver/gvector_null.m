function Z=gvector_null( T )
% GVECTOR_NULL Create a sparse null vector with correct dimensions.
%   Z=GVECTOR_NULL( T ) create a sparse vector product with the same
%   dimensions as the vector T (which is used as kind of a model). In more
%   detail: suppose T consists of an N*K and an M*K matrix then Z will
%   consist of an N*0 and an M*0 matrix.
%
% Example (<a href="matlab:run_example gvector_null">run</a>)
%   T={rand(8,3), rand(10,3)}
%   Z=gvector_null(T)
%   norm( Z{1}*Z{2}', 'fro' ) % should be zero
